Silly cli dice program.
Just run build.sh to build

To use:
- Type `h` for help
- Type `q` to quit
- Type a sequence of space-separated dnd "dice rolls" and the program will evaluate it. For example, if you run `>2d6`, then the program will roll two d6 die. If you wish to only roll one die, then the first number can be ommited, so that d6 will be evaluated as a single d6 roll. If you run `>2d6 d5`, then the program will roll two d6 and one d5
- Type `.` to repeat the last roll.
